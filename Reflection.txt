I hosted my calculator app online using Streamlit Community Cloud. First, I uploaded my project to GitHub and made sure it had all the needed files. Then, I connected the repository to Streamlit Cloud and clicked deploy to make it live. One challenge I faced was changing the code from using input() and print() to using Streamlit boxes and buttons. I tried to figure it out, but because of the approaching due date, I decided to get help from AI. First, I made my code in OnlineGDB using Python, then I asked AI to convert it so it would work in Streamlit. Hosting it online makes my app more useful because anyone can open it from a phone, tablet, or computer without downloading anything. I also learned that cloud hosting makes projects easier to share and access. Overall, it was fun to see my calculator working online.

# Reflection
I hosted my calculator app online using Streamlit Community Cloud. First, I uploaded my project to GitHub and made sure it had all the necessary files. I originally wrote my code in OnlineGDB using Python, then I asked AI to help convert it so it would work in Streamlit. Next, I connected the repository to Streamlit Cloud and clicked deploy to make it live. One of the challenges I faced was changing the code from using input() and print() to using Streamlit boxes and buttons. Hosting it online makes my app more useful because anyone can open it from a phone, tablet, or computer without downloading anything. Overall, it was fun to see my calculator working online.
